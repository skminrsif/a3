                    NPC and Boss Sprites, Made with https://0x72.itch.io/pixeldudesmaker
                    Apricot and Milk Sprites, made by me.

    I keep getting the NullReferenceException error; my coin sprites do not show up on the inventory slots. I made the entire tutorial in a separate project, and copied and pasted it to this assignment folder. In my original project folder, the sprites for the coin show up on the inventory slot. In this assignment folder, it does not. I have no clue why. But for some weird reason, my apricot and milk sprites show up on the inventory slot. So, I am guessing that there is something wrong with my slots accepting stackable items, however the quantity does change. Therefore, I am not sure what the reason is for that error.

    I am not entirely sure how to make the enemy change direction to an angle opposite of its current angle.

    I was going to put both an item quest and a boss kill quest, but I ran out of time. Therefore, I only did a boss kill quest.

    I am not sure what the assignment meant by on-screen message (not sure if it's a whole cutscene with a dialogue box or just a dialogue box that pops up above the NPC's head). Therefore, I only did the latter (message that pops up above the NPC's head).

    Make sure to not kill the boss outside its area, or else it will not count as a quest complete. Thank you.
