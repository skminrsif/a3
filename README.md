### How to get started

- Step 1: Clone this repository to your local using `git clone <repo link>`. Note that the repository has some files aleady which is this file and a git specific file. You do not need to touch the gitignore one. 
- Step 2: Now we need to start a Unity project here. 
  - **If you have a project already**: Copy paste the project folders (Assets, Packages, Project Settings etc) into your cloned repository. DO NOT copy the folder containing the project folders.(That is, if your Unity project is under the `Project1` folder, you should copy all contents of the `Project1` folder and not the `Project1` folder itself.)
  - **If you need to create a new project**: In Unity - Create a new project and change the location of the project to be in the cloned git folder. 

- Step 3: Commit and Push the changes. 

- Step 4: Continue working on the assignment on Unity as you would normally do and commit + push the code using the git bash command line as specified in the `Git Fundamentals` document on nexus. You can commit the entire assignment folder at once, or you can commit subfolders separately. 

**NOTE**: Some folders and files which are in a Unity project might not be pushed to the remote repository and hence you will not be able to see them on github even after pushing your changes. There is no need to worry, this is *intentional* and is done to make sure that the extra Unity files which can be re-generated later by the TAs are not uploaded/pushed on github, since that consumes a lot of storage on the repository. This is done by the `.gitignore` file which specifies all the files that git can ignore to be tracked and hence they will not be pushed.
